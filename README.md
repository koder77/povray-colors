POVray - colors
===============
This is just a Rust learning project from me. It is my first Rust program.
The program converts RGB values (0-255) to the POVray colors: (0.0 - 1.0).

It is like this:

```
Enter rgb color, only RETURN to exit:
r? 42
g? 128
b? 255
color rgb<0.1647, 0.5020, 1.0000>
```

If you just press RETURN on "r?" then you exit the program.
Have some fun!
